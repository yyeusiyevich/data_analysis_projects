## Description :key:
Our customer is a charitable online platform - [ProCharity](https://procharity.ru/). ProCharity is an opportunity for professionals to help non-profit organizations with issues that require specialized knowledge and expertise. Intellectual volunteers donate their time and professional skills to the fund, allowing them to solve problems that are difficult to handle with the resources of regular staff. The platform allows NGOs to find helpers, volunteers to bring value with their knowledge, skills and experience, and partner companies to increase employee loyalty and incorporate charity into their processes.

## Tasks :ballot_box_with_check:

The goal of the project is to analyze volunteer user behavior and activity, and report on key metrics such as registration, moderation, and retention dynamics.
