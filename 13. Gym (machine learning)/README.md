## Description :key:
In this project, we work as gym chain analysts. The company develops an analytics-driven user engagement strategy. We solve the common problem of gyms and other services - a customer churn. For the gym, we will consider that the customer has left, if they don't come for a month. We work with data provided to us by customer department - user profiles.

- predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer;

    - suggest measures to cut churn;
    - describe any other patterns with respect to interaction with customers.
