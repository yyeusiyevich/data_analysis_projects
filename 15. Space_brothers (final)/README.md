- developing the game application monetization model;
- exploratory data analysis based on three different datasets;
- creatiing of a presentation on the results of the study;
- presenting target events as dynamic dashboard;

## Scope of activities :bulb:
Startups, Tech-company, Gamedev, Gaming, Internet Services, Marketing analyst, Data Analyst.

## Description :key:
The coronavirus has caught the world off guard, changing the familiar order of things. In their free time, city dwellers no longer go out on the street, visit cafes and shopping centers. But there is more time for books. In this project, we work with a database of information about books, publishers, authors, and user reviews of books. This data will help formulate a value proposition for a new product - an online application for those who love to read. ERD provided in files.

## Tasks :ballot_box_with_check:
Analyze the database and answer the following questions:
- How many books have been released after January 1, 2000;
- The number of reviews and the average rating of each book;
- The publisher that has released the most books thicker than 50 pages;
- The author with the highest average rating of books (among books with 50 or more ratings);
- The average number of reviews from users who have given more than 50 ratings.

# A/B - test
## Description :key:
In this project we will assess the results of the A/B test. We are working with data on user actions, technical task data, and auxiliary tables.

## Tasks :ballot_box_with_check:
The objectives of the research are:
- evaluation of the correctness of the test using the z-criterion;
- analysis of the results;
To evaluate the correctness of the test, we will check the intersection of the test audience with the competing test, as well as the coincidence of the test and marketing events and some other problems of the temporal boundaries of the test.


## Scope of activities :bulb:
A/B Testing, User Actions, Technical Task, Data Analysis, Z-Criterion, Test Audience, Marketing Events.


## Used Libraries :mortar_board:
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Plotly.
