## Description :key:
The coronavirus has caught the world off guard, changing the familiar order of things. In their free time, city dwellers no longer go out on the street, visit cafes and shopping centers. But there is more time for books. In this project, we work with a database of information about books, publishers, authors, and user reviews of books. This data will help formulate a value proposition for a new product - an online application for those who love to read.

## Tasks :ballot_box_with_check:
Analyze the database and answer the following questions:
- How many books have been released after January 1, 2000;
- The number of reviews and the average rating of each book;
- The publisher that has released the most books thicker than 50 pages;
- The author with the highest average rating of books (among books with 50 or more ratings);
- The average number of reviews from users who have given more than 50 ratings.
