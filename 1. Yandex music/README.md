## Description :key:
In this project we were working as data analysts of Yandex Music platform. In terms of project we had to compare users' preferences in two megapolices - Moscow and St. Petersburg. Data was provided by the platform and it contained information about users and tracks they listened on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8:00 am. to 10:00 pm.


## Tasks :ballot_box_with_check:
The main goal of the project was to test three hypotheses:

1. User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg it also differs.
2. On Monday mornings, certain genres prevail in Moscow, while others prevail in St. Petersburg. The same goes for Friday evenings, depending on the city.
3. People in Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres: pop music is more popular in Moskow, in St. Petersburg - russian rap.
