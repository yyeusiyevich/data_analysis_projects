## Description :key:
In this project we work as data analysts at Yandex Zen. Most of our time is spent analyzing user interaction with article cards. To answer managers' questions about how users interact with the platform, we create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard is based on the pipeline, which takes data from the raw data table and transforms it into an aggregating table. This pipeline was developed for us by data engineers.
  
## Tasks :ballot_box_with_check:
The dashboard should answer the questions below:
  1. How many card interactions do we have in the system per card theme?
  2. How many cards generate sources with different themes?
  3. How do card themes relate to source themes?
