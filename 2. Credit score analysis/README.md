## Description :key:
Our customer - the bank loan division. We want to figure out whether specified customers' characteristic affects the repaying of a loan on time. The data we work with is customersâ€™ creditworthiness from the bank. The result of the research will be taken in the credit scoring model - a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay the loan.
